# Advent of Code 2023 - Go Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges implemented in the Go programming language. Each day's solution is organized in its own directory, named accordingly (e.g., day01, day02, ...).

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. Each day, participants are presented with two programming puzzles to solve. It's a fun and challenging way to improve your coding skills and explore different problem-solving approaches.

## Structure
The root directory contains common utility functions and structures used across multiple days. Each day's directory (day01, day02, ...) includes the Go source code (main.go), input files (input.txt), and any additional resources.

## Running Solutions
To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Go program:

Example:

<pre>
  cd day01
  go run main.go
</pre>
